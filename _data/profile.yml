  <p>
    I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in the school of Information and Software Engineering.
    I received my Ph.D. from the University of Virginia, advised by Prof. Felix Xiaozhu Lin.
    My research is in the intersection of OS x Arch x PL, under the umbrella of efficiency and security.   
  </p>

  <p>
    Prior to UESTC and the facultyship, I was lucky to be awarded <a href="https://career.huawei.com/reccampportal/portal5/topminds.html">Top Minds</a> from Huawei, where I had a little dabble in industry. 
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>What I do:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Old-fashioned, old-school OS kernels</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>an in-depth analysis of Rust-for-Linux (<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc24/presentation/li-hongyu">USENIX ATC'24</a>, <strong>Best Paper Award (first in China)</strong>)</li>
                <li>a built-from-scratch software virtual machine with an inverse guest/host paradigm (<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc19/presentation/guo">USENIX ATC'19</a>)</li>
                <li>an OS abstraction which provides energy isolation (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3190508.3190533">EUROSYS'18</a>)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>Trustworthy computing</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>device drivers which run fully inside Arm TrustZone (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3492321.3519565">EUROSYS'22</a>)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>Resource-efficient LLM</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>an elastic IO/compute pipeline for efficient transformer inference (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3575693.3575698">ASPLOS'23</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10906629">TMC'25</a>)</li>
