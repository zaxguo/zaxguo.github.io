  We present a novel OS model for heterogeneous multi-processors, which executes unmodified energy-consuming kernel code of a CPU on a microcontroller-like peripheral core. By combining DBT and emulation, a transkernel bridges ISA gaps and caters to core asymmetry with an inverse guest/host virtualization paradigm. Transkernel is inspired by various video game emulators.
